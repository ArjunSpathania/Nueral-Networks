Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the progress of COVID-19 vaccination efforts across various counties in California. By measuring the percentage of the population that has been vaccinated and identifying the remaining population, this analysis seeks to determine if adjustments are necessary to ensure timely vaccination for all residents. Additionally, the project evaluates the impact of vaccination rates on the reduction of COVID-19 cases and fatalities, providing valuable insights into the ongoing public health efforts.

Objective

The primary objective is to study the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines across California counties and assess their effectiveness in curbing the spread of the virus. The project will identify any disparities in vaccine distribution and visualize key trends in vaccination rates, booster administration, and case reduction. This analysis will help raise awareness and inform decisions on resource allocation and public health strategies.

Key Hypotheses

Vaccine Preference: Pfizer vaccines were preferred over Johnson & Johnson (by 17.5x) and Moderna (by 1.5x) in California due to availability.
Vaccination Disparities: Los Angeles County has the highest vaccination rate due to its population density, representing approximately one-third of the state's total population.
Impact on Mortality: The mortality rate in California decreased by 0.004% in 2022 compared to 2021, attributed to the 72% higher vaccine administration in 2021.
Vaccination Decline in San Diego: COVID-19 cases in San Diego County increased by 41% as vaccination rates declined between 2021 and 2022 compared to 2020.
Booster Distribution: Counties with higher COVID-19 cases are administering booster and bivalent doses at a higher rate than those with lower case rates.
Data Sources

The dataset used for this analysis summarizes COVID-19 vaccination data at the county level, focusing on the number of doses administered, the types of vaccines used, and the distribution of booster shots. Data attributes include:

County of residence for vaccine recipients
Total doses administered (Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson)
Cumulative doses administered
Booster and bivalent booster eligibility and recipient counts
Data Source Link: COVID-19 Vaccination Progress Dataset

Conclusion

By understanding the distribution of vaccines and their impact on public health in California, this project provides a comprehensive look at the vaccination campaignâ€™s effectiveness and highlights areas for potential improvement in vaccine distribution and public health strategies.
